            <h1 class="sample">CAFFEINE Functionality</h1>
            <p class="sample">The CAFFEINE feature increases the overall efficiency of your company's employees. It has
                both short- and long-term properties. CAFFEINE should be introduced to each employee in
                liquid state called coffee. It has the best impact at the beginning of the work shift. The
                maximum amount of CAFFEINE per employee varies and is dependent on the current tasks of
                said employee. As a rule of thumb, the more tasks an employee has, the more CAFFEINE
                should be introduced.</p>
            <p class="important"><b>IMPORTANT: </b>Once CAFFEINE has been introduced to your company, remember to keep a
                one-week supply buffer in storage, as when employees will be cut off from the coffee
                supply their efficiency will drop dramatically.</p>
            <h2 class="sample">How to Enable CAFFEINE</h2>
