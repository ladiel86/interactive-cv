            <p class="sample">A snippet (file with .flsnp extension) is a piece of content that can be used repeatedly in multiple HTM files. 
                Its content can be formatted the same way as any other HTM file and it can contain any type of HTML element (text, images, tables).</p>
            <p class="sample">By using snippets, you have the possibility to change the content in one place. Each HTM file using this snippet 
                will have the same content automatically. This makes your documentation easier to update and avoid having outdated information.</p>
            <p class="note"><b>NOTE: </b>The content of a snippet file is the same as in an HTM file. However, when inserting a snippet to an HTM file only its 
                <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> content is added.</p>
            <p class="sample">You can enable snippet auto suggestion so that Flare will suggest a snippet that matches the text you are typing. To enable it, go to 
                <b>File > Options > Auto Suggestion</b>.</p>

            <h1 class="sample">CAFFEINE Functionality</h1>
            <p class="sample">The CAFFEINE feature increases the overall efficiency of your company's employees. It has
                both short- and long-term properties. CAFFEINE should be introduced to each employee in
                liquid state called coffee. It has the best impact at the beginning of the work shift. The
                maximum amount of CAFFEINE per employee varies and is dependent on the current tasks of
                said employee. As a rule of thumb, the more tasks an employee has, the more CAFFEINE
                should be introduced.</p>
            <p class="important"><b>IMPORTANT: </b>Once CAFFEINE has been introduced to your company, remember to keep a
                one-week supply buffer in storage, as when employees will be cut off from the coffee
                supply their efficiency will drop dramatically.</p>
            <h2 class="sample">How to Enable CAFFEINE</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Buy the most expensive espresso machines as Primary (one per 20 employees).</li>
                <li>Buy at least two more as Backups.</li>
                <li>Buy non-grounded coffee supply (0.5 kg per employee).</li>
                <li>Install the espresso machines evenly around the workspace.</li>
                <li>Stick ~20 flyers around the espresso machine containing different procedures and rules
                    on how to use the machine.</li>
                <li>Hire a maintenance crew and station them as close to the espresso machines.</li>
                <li>Setup a rule in Outlook to automatically forward any e-mail containing words like <code>coffee</code>
                    or <code>espresso</code> to the maintenance crew for quick response in case of an espresso machine failure.</li>
